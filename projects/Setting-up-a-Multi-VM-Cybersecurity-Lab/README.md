# Detection Lab

## Objective
The **Detection Lab** project was designed to build a controlled environment for **simulating and detecting cyberattacks**.  
Its primary purpose was to:
- Ingest and analyze logs using a **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** system.
- Generate test telemetry to mimic **real-world attack scenarios**.
- Strengthen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

---

### Skills Learned
- Practical knowledge of **SIEM implementation and configuration**.
- Ability to **analyze and interpret logs** for potential security incidents.
- Experience in generating and detecting **attack signatures and patterns**.
- Improved understanding of **network protocols and common vulnerabilities**.
- Enhanced **critical thinking and problem-solving skills** in cybersecurity operations.

---

### Tools Used
- **SIEM platform** (e.g., Splunk or ELK Stack) for log ingestion and analysis.
- **Wireshark** for network traffic capture and packet analysis.
- **Attack simulation tools** (like Metasploit or custom scripts) for generating telemetry.
- **Virtualization environment** (VirtualBox/VMware) to host isolated lab systems.
